/// A snapshot of the Chip8 internal state
///
/// ## CPU
/// Registers
/// - (v) 16 primary 8-bit registers (V0..VF)
///     - the first 15 (V0..VE) are general purpose registers
///     - the 16th (VF) is the carry flag
/// - (i) a 16-bit memory address register
///
/// Counter
/// - (pc) a 16-bit program counter
///
/// Pointer
/// - (sp) a 8-bit stack pointer
///
/// Timers
/// - 2 8-bit timers (delay & sound)
/// - When the sound timer is decremented it plays a beep
///
/// ## Memory
/// - 32 byte stack
///     - stores return addresses when subroutines are called
///     - conflicting sources cite the size as being anywhere from 32-64 bytes
/// - 4096 bytes of addressable memory
/// - 32x64 byte frame buffer
///     - stores the contents of the next frame to be drawn
///
/// ## Input
/// - 16-bit array to track the pressed status of keys 0..F
/// - Emulation may halt until a key's value is written to Some register
///
/// ## Timing
/// - The CPU should have a clock speed of 500Hz
/// - The timers should be decremented at 60Hz
///     - this is approximated as once every 8 CPU cycles
